# rapid_reports
A home for reports on RAPID data collection, including recruitment trends, survey durations, demographics, etc
This page will eventually include reports on:
- survey participation by recruitment source over time
- survey duration over time (whole survey as well as individual modules)
- differences in survey duration for different demographic groups
- data on where people tend to drop out of the survey or experience big slow-downs
- demographic makeup of participants over time
- possibly data on results from different advertising efforts such as facebook
